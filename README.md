# Screaming Satellites 
_An expansion of the research done in Screaming Channels with a focus on small satellites_

This repository provides source code and artifacts to support the three article series exploring the potential data leaks across broadcasts of System-on-a-Chip transceivers used by (or potentially used by) small satellites. The articles in this series build on each other to ultimately provide a framework and process for identifying and measuring _Screaming Channels_ data leaks. The articles in this series are:
1. [Understanding How System-on-a-Chip Data can Leak over Radio Transmissions](https://www.ijatl.org/)
2. [Identifying System-on-a-Chip Data Leaks over Radio Transmissions of Small Satellites](https://www.ijatl.org/)
3. [Measuring System-on-a-Chip Data Leaks over Radio Transmissions of Small Satellites](https://www.ijatl.org/)
