# Screaming Satellites 
_An expansion of the research done in [Screaming Channels](https://eurecom-s3.github.io/screaming_channels/) with a focus on small satellites_

This repository provides source code and artifacts to support the three article series exploring the potential data leaks across broadcasts of System-on-a-Chip transceivers used by (or potentially used by) small satellites. The articles in this series build on each other to ultimately provide a framework and process for identifying and measuring _Screaming Channels_ data leaks. The articles in this series are:
1. (Article #1) [_Understanding How System-on-a-Chip Data can Leak over Radio Transmissions_](https://www.ijatl.org/wp-content/uploads/journal/published_paper/volume-3/issue-1/article_iNHFKbcN.pdf) 
2. (Article #2) [_Identifying System-on-a-Chip Data Leaks over Radio Transmissions of Small Satellites_](https://www.ijatl.org/wp-content/uploads/journal/published_paper/volume-3/issue-1/article_mj9YLZud.pdf)
3. (Article #3) [_Measuring System-on-a-Chip Data Leaks over Radio Transmissions of Small Satellites_](https://www.ijatl.org/) _pending publication_

## Reproducing Experiments from Article #2
Article #2 provided a process for identifying potential leaks in SoC transceivers. The process was demonstrated using four real-world devices. The source code and binaries used in those demonstrations is available here and the steps below outline the process. 

1. Load firmware on the device
   1. **Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832** [source](https://github.com/eurecom-s3/screaming_channels) | [script](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/blob/main/interfacing-scripts/alternate-sleep-active/nRF52832.py) 
      + The nRF52832 firmware was developed for the 2018 Screaming Channels research. An additional script is used to exercise the firmware according to the process described in Article #2
   2. **Texas Instruments CC1111** [source](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/cc1111/alternate-sleep-active) | [binary](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/cc1111/alternate-sleep-active/binary) | [dev environment](https://www.iar.com/products/architectures/iar-embedded-workbench-for-8051/) | [flashing software](https://www.ti.com/tool/FLASH-PROGRAMMER)
   3. **Texas Instruments CC1310** [source](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/cc1310) | [binary](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/cc1310/binary) | [script](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/blob/main/interfacing-scripts/alternate-sleep-active/cc1310.py) | [dev environment](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO) | [flashing software](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO)
      + The CC1310 firmware mirrors the firmware used in the 2018 Screaming Channels research and thus requires an additional script to exercise it in accordance with the process described in Article #2
   4. **Seeed LoRa Wio-E5** [source](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/wio-e5-mini/alternate-sleep-active) | [binary](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/blob/main/firmware/wio-e5-mini/alternate-sleep-active/binary/WioE5Mini-alternate-sleep-and-active.hex) | [dev environment](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) | [flashing software](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)
   5. **Other devices** the above four devices were included in the research of this series. If you are evaluating a different device, you will need to develop firmware for the device following the process outlined in Article #2 
2. Listen for Transmissions
   1. Setup [Gnuradio and GnuRadio Companion (GRC)](https://www.gnuradio.org/)
   2. Download the [.GRC script](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/gnu-radio-visualization) developed for this experiment
      + If needed, alter the file to meet your requirements. For instance, the script includes acceptable ranges for frequency and signal gain. These may need to be adjusted to meet the requirements for your specific requirements
3. Exercise the Firmware
   + The CC1111 and Wio-E5 firmware automatically begins iterating through patterns of sleeping and processing
   + The nRF52832 and CC1310 firmware provides more robust functionality and is exercised according to the process described in Article #2 using an external Python script
4. Adjust Parameters and Observe the results
   + The Receiver gain, Intermediate gain, Baseband gain, and receiving frequency can all be adjusted through slider controls in the user interface created by the GRC script. Adjusting these values can make a signal easier or harder to identify within the noise. Finding the right balance for these parameters will depend on the hardware and environment in question. Iterating through combinations of values is a time-consuming but unavoidable step.
   + Compare the GRC output to the results provided in Article #2

## Reproducing Experiments from Article #3
1. Load firmware on the device
   1. **Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832** [source](https://github.com/eurecom-s3/screaming_channels) | [script](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/interfacing-scripts/create-encryption-traces/nRF52832) 
   2. **Texas Instruments CC1111** [source](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/cc1111/create-encryption-traces) | [binary](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/cc1111/create-encryption-traces/binary) | [dev environment](https://www.iar.com/products/architectures/iar-embedded-workbench-for-8051/) | [flashing software](https://www.ti.com/tool/FLASH-PROGRAMMER)
   3. **Texas Instruments CC1310** [source](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/cc1310) | [binary](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/cc1310/binary) | [script](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/interfacing-scripts/create-encryption-traces/cc1310) | [dev environment](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO) | [flashing software](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO)
   4. **Seeed LoRa Wio-E5** [source](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/tree/main/firmware/wio-e5-mini/create-encryption-traces) | [binary](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/blob/main/firmware/wio-e5-mini/create-encryption-traces/binary/WioE5Mini-alternate-sleep-and-active.hex) | [dev environment](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) | [flashing software](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)
   5. **Other devices** the above two devices were included in the research of this series. If you are evaluating a different device, you will need to develop firmware for the device following the process outlined in Article #3 
2. Collect traces of cryptographic processes
   1. Setup [Gnuradio and GnuRadio Companion (GRC)](https://www.gnuradio.org/)
   2. Use the collection script developed for this research. Note that this script is a new module developed version of the Screaming Channels scripting ported to Python3
   + Easiest way to run the script is by building the docker container and then running the Python script to start it with the necessary parameters. 
   + You will need to adjust parameters in the config.json file for your target device
3. (Optional) Extract the traces
   + Depending on how the traces were collected, an additional step may be required to break apart the individual traces or extract the meaningful segment
      + _Extracting_: To trim excess content from a trace, it can be useful to trigger a detectable amplitude change. If this approach was taken, each trace will need to be processed to extract the meaningul portion. For this research, this task was accomplished using a configurable Jupyter Notebook [extract_between_spikes](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/utilities/extract_between_spikes.ipynb)
      + _Splitting_: If traces were collected as a group (all part of the same file) then the file will need to be broken into individual traces for the remainder of the analysis. To accomplish this, we used a configurable Jupyter Notebook [break_apart_traces](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/utilities/break_apart_traces.ipynb)
5. Aligning the traces
   + Aligning the traces is a key step as misalignment will skew results. The phase alignment algorithm the [Signal Alignment module](https://github.com/pearsonkyle/Signal-Alignment) by Kyle Pearson was used in this project. This algorithm is implemented in a configurable Jupyter Notebook [align_and_resize_traces](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/utilities/align_and_resize_traces.ipynb)
7. Analyze the traces
   + The analysis described in Article #3 uses Welch's t-test and signal-to-noise ratios to characterize any potential data leaks based on common leakage models. Refer to the article for an in-depth discussion of the analysis. For repeatability, the analysis is codified into a Jupyter Notebook [data-leak-analysis](https://github.com/GallagherTom/screaming_satellites/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/data-leak-analysis.ipynb)
